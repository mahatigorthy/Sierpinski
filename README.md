# Sierpinski

The Sierpinski triangle is a fractal named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński. It is constructed by recursively removing triangles from a larger triangle, creating a geometric pattern with self-repeating smaller triangles.

The Sierpinski carpet is a similar fractal pattern, but it is based on squares instead of triangles. In this case, smaller squares are recursively removed from a larger square, resulting in a complex and visually intriguing pattern.
